False. The defense is randomizing the source port (in addition to the DNS ID #). The destination port needs to be known, since it’s the port used by the server (which needs to listen for DNS requests on a known specific port).\n\n11. Compared to TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3 reduces the number of round trips required for the TLS handshake.\n   a. True. That was the design advantage of TLS 1.3 over TLS 1.2.\n\n12. TLS uses asymmetric cryptography for key exchange and symmetric cryptography for the rest of the connection’s data transmission.\n   a. True. TLS first uses RSA/DH key exchange to select symmetric crypto keys, then uses those symmetric keys for everything else.\n\n13. TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 both support RSA and Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n   a. False. TLS 1.3 removes RSA as a key exchange option, as it doesn’t offer perfect forward secrecy.\n\nMultiple Choice Questions\n\nGrading Rubric:\n- 4 pts if fully correct\n- 2 point if some choices are correct, but did not get all correct choices (or chose incorrect choices)\n- Only incorrect choices got 0 pts\n\n1. Let’s say a router wants to route to IP address 18.0.0.1, and has the following entries in its routing table (e.g., the routes it has previously learned and selected via BGP). Which route would be picked for 18.0.0.1?\n   a. Subnet = 18.0.0.0/8 ; AS-PATH = A,B ; Cost = 20\n   b. Subnet = 18.0.0.0/10 ; AS-PATH = A,C ; Cost = 20\n   c. Subnet = 18.0.0.0/18 ; AS-PATH = A,C,D ; Cost = 25\n   d. Subnet = 18.0.0.0/24 ; AS-PATH = A,C,E ; Cost = 25\n\nWith routing to a specific IP, we’ll use the longest prefix match. The routing table already has the “best” route to a specific subnet, so we find the most specific subnet to that IP.\n\n2. Which of the following are true about TLS? (Select all that apply)\n   a. SSL is the newest version of TLS\n   b. TLS is an application-layer protocol\n   c. TLS 1.2 has a 3-way handshake\n   d. TLS uses 4 symmetric cryptographic keys (2 for encryption, 2 for integrity)\n\nA is wrong as SSL is the old version of TLS, now deprecated. B is true as TLS is indeed application-layer as it sits above the network layer. C is wrong as TLS 1.2 has a 4-way handshake; TCP has a 3-way handshake. D is correct, as TLS generates one encryption and one integrity key for the client, and one encryption and one integrity key for the server (so 4 keys total).', 'source': 'olmocr', 'added': '2025-04-14', 'created': '2025-04-14', 'metadata': {'Source-File': 'uploads/455016b7-7e82-40d5-9c34-f9cac80b5b29_3.jpg', 'olmocr-version': '0.1.60', 'pdf-total-pages': 1, 'total-input-tokens': 1143, 'total-output-tokens': 708, 'total-fallback-pages': 0}, 'attributes': {'pdf_page_numbers': [[0, 2324, 1]]}}, 'result_valid': True, 'status_history': [{'timestamp': 1744623076.4501932, 'elapsed': 0.01013636589050293, 'status': 'processing', 'queue_position': None}, {'timestamp': 1744623081.4588287, 'elapsed': 5.0187718868255615, 'status': 'processing', 'queue_position': None}, {'timestamp': 1744623086.466144, 'elapsed': 10.026087284088135, 'status': 'processing', 'queue_position': None}, {'timestamp': 1744623091.4721415, 'elapsed': 15.032084703445435, 'status': 'processing', 'queue_position': None}, {'timestamp': 1744623096.4780462, 'elapsed': 20.037989377975464, 'status': 'completed', 'queue_position': None}], 'total_processing_time': 20.037991285324097}",True,True,True

With BGP, routes to a subnet are selected primarily based on economic/financial factors (e.g., cost), with other factors such as shorter AS paths or lower latencies being secondary factors.\n   a. True. Cost is the main factor for BGP routes.\n\n2. If two ASes have a peering relationship, they will route each other’s traffic for free, for certain routes as agreed upon when establishing the peering relationship.\n   a. True. This is exactly the definition of a peering relationship.\n\n3. Route Origin Validation (ROV) implemented on all routers would provide integrity over the entire AS-PATH for all routes in BGP advertisements/announcements.\n   a. False. ROV only provides integrity over the originating AS.\n\n4. TCP sequence numbers start at 0.\n   a. False. They are randomly chosen initial values to prevent easy prediction.\n\n5. TCP requires a 4-way handshake to establish a connection.\n   a. False. TCP requires a 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN+ACK, ACK).\n\n6. Let’s say Eve knows Alice has a TCP connection with Bob, and wants to inject data into the TCP stream. To do so, Eve would at least need to know the IP addresses, ports, and sequence numbers used in the TCP connection by Alice and Bob.\n   a. True. Then Eve can spoof a valid-looking TCP packet, with the right address and port to get to Alice/Bob’s TCP connection, and the right sequence numbers for them to accept the packet as part of the TCP stream.\n\n7. DNSSEC provides integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality.\n   a. False. DNSSEC doesn’t provide confidentiality.\n\n8. Without DNS bailiwick checking, the gatech.edu authoritative name server could do a DNS cache poisoning attack and set the cached A record for uga.edu at a recursive resolver.\n   a. True, this is the example we showed in class (except for mit.edu NS setting the facebook.com record).\n\n9. An attacker wishes to spoof a UDP response packet. To do so, the attacker only has to guess the UDP identification number correctly.\n   a. False. UDP does not have an ID number.\n\n10.
